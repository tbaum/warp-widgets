        This page demonstrates the use of the Viewport component in Warp, by including the content of the counter demo.<br/>
        Notice that the embedded page is set as the event delegate and so we inherit the counter demo's functionality as-is. However, the managed
        properties of the Counter object are not considered managed properties of this page--because it is being embedded as a component and not a page,
        and therefore @Managed functionality is not inherited.

        <span w:component="viewport" w:embed="${counter}" w:ajax="${true}">
            The content of the counter demo should show up here.
