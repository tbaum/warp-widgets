    <i>
        This page demonstrates the use of the Viewport component in Warp, by including the content of the counter demo.<br/>
    </i>

    <p>
        Notice that the embedded page is set as the event delegate and so we inherit the counter demo's functionality as-is. However, the managed
        properties of the Counter object are not considered managed properties of this page--because it is being embedded as a component and not a page,
        and therefore @Managed functionality is not inherited.
    </p>

    <h3>Page embedded in viewport normally:</h3>
    <p> 
        <span w:component="viewport" w:embed="${counter}">
            The content of the counter demo should show up here.
        </span>
    </p>


    <h3>Page embedded in viewport via ajax:</h3>
    <p>
        <div w:component="viewport" w:embed="${ajaxCounter}" w:ajax="true">
            The content of the counter demo should show up here.
        </div>
    </p>
