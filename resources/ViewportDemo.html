        This page demonstrates the use of the Viewport component in Warp, by including the content of the counter demo in various ways.<br/>
    </i>

    <p>
        Notice that the embedded page is set as the event delegate and so we inherit the counter demo's functionality as-is.
    </p>

    <h3>Page embedded in viewport normally:</h3>
    <p> 
        <span w:component="viewport" w:embed="${counter}">
            The content of the counter demo should show up here.
        </span>
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Component direct use (custom attribs bound to embedded counter page):</h3>
    <p>
        <span w:component="counter" counter="${counter.counter}"> <!-- pass in any attributes so long as it is not w: prefixed
        these are passed on to the counter page -->
            The content of the counter demo should show up here.
        </span>
